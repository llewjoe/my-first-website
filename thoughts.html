                <p id="cmtpara1">I had lots of fun working on this module. I found it to be a great, multi-faceted introduction to the discipline of computational thinking. The introduction to HTML and CSS has allowed me, a relative beginner to any programming environment, to get to grips with the fundamental practices of creating things by building up code.</p>
                <p id="cmtpara2">I have tried to approach this assessment in a structured way by breaking the task down into its criteria. I began by drawing out a wireframe diagram, and spent a few days reading up on CT and my chosen biography before I started with any coding.<br>I am now approaching my other modules with this in mind â€“ programming is not second nature to me, but I am confident now that learning to solve problems logically is made easier and less daunting by being patient and starting with the basics, rather than rushing into things or being overly concerned about learning all of the correct programming syntax.</p>
                <p id="cmtpara3">I have sought to understand elements of responsive design and to implement some of them in the structure of this website, having a go at <tt>css-flexbox</tt> and <tt>css-grid</tt>. A pleasant and readable experience is crucial when laying out webpages for a range of viewing media, just as it has long been in print media. I am excited to explore the potential in using <tt>css-grid</tt> to develop dynamic web layouts. I really enjoy the creative process and will put what I have learned to use in making a simple webpage to display my personal photography.</p>
                <img id="cmtimg1" src="img/cmt1.png">
                <p id="cmtpara4">I have tried to make this website a bit of fun, harking back to 1990s design styles by working with one strong colour, some classic typefaces (WordArt included) and sparing use of CSS.<br> I took the opportunity to use this module to get to grips with Git. After every significant change to the website files I would commit and push my changes, just to get into the habit of using version control.</p>
                <p id="cmtpara5">I have also hugely enjoyed the challenge of embracing binary arithmetic. It's the hardest I've had to work the mathematical part of my brain since completing my A-levels. It's given me an interest to research the fundamentals of binary circuitry and logic gates and how these innovations made the first electronic computers possible. I love to mess about with computer hardware so it has been great to dig deeper into what makes these machines tick.</p>
                <div id="cmtpara6">
                    <p>Generally, the module has allowed me to assess the ways in which I learn and work best.<br>My basic prior knowledge of HTML and CSS has allowed me to gauge the speed at which I can build existing skills. CMT120 (Introduction to Programming) has been challenging but by decomposing problems, finding the generalisations and removing unnecessary distractions it is clear to me how much easier it becomes to find solutions to exercises in Python and JavaScript. I will do my best to keep these fundamentals with me as I move ahead through the course.</p>
